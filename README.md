Experimental Setup

To reproduce our experiment or run your own privacy analysis using TrapTrack, follow the steps below:


1. Install All Dependencies

Before starting, make sure you’ve set up the environment:

Python 3.10 or higher

Playwright (headless browser automation)

MITMproxy (for traffic interception)

All other packages listed in the requirements (you can use pip install -r requirements.txt if available)


2. Set Up Your Test Website

Open the file test_sites.csv in the project root.

By default, it contains: https://www.amazon.co.uk, EU

You can replace or add more sites to this file in the same format: Website URL,Consent Type (e.g., Accept All or Reject All)


3. Start MITMproxy in Logging Mode

In Terminal Window 1, navigate to the TrapTrack project directory.

Run the following command:
o	mitmdump -s network_logger.py

This step is essential for logging all outbound network requests made during the browsing session.


4. Launch the TrapTrack Analysis Pipeline

In Terminal Window 2, also navigate to your TrapTrack folder.

Start the program using:
o	python run_all.py

This script will:
o	Verify MITMproxy is running.

o	Load URLs from test_sites.csv.

o	Open a Chromium browser via Playwright to simulate user interaction.'


5. Interact with the Website Like a Real User

When the browser launches:

o	Wait for the cookie consent banner to appear.

o	Click Accept, Reject, or any available choice (based on your test plan).

o	Spend 30–60 seconds browsing click on links, view product pages, scroll around.

This mimics genuine behavior and triggers any consent-based tracking scripts.


6. Continue the Analysis

Once you’ve explored enough, go back to Terminal 2.

The script will prompt:

o	🕹️ Surf manually in the browser... Press [Enter] here when done...

Simply press Enter to begin post-consent data capture.


7. Automated Modules Will Execute in Sequence

The following tools will now run automatically:

•	geo_analyzer.py – Maps all third-party tracker IPs to their physical countries.

•	trapscore.py – Calculates a privacy risk score based on behavior.

•	generate_html_report.py – Creates an HTML report with visuals and metrics.


8. View the Final Report

After processing, your browser will open a new tab showing:

o	Before & after screenshots

o	Storage differences (cookies/local/session)

o	GeoIP map of tracker countries

o	Final TrapScore with detailed breakdown



I had also uploaded the pdfs of my Amazon surfing and Euro News dashboard for your reference incase anyone needs to check.

These are named as:
